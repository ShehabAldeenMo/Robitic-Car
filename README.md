I come with new project and new challenge in Embbeded system (Robitic Car).

The goal of the project was to design and implement an autonomous car that could
navigate without any human intervention .

To achieve this, we used a variety of embedded systems such as sensors and
actuators to create a sophisticated control system that could process inputs
from the environment and make decisions in real-time.

And We used algorithms to improve the car's ability to recognize and respond to different situations.

It have 4 modes :-
--> Control mode using bluetooth .
--> Follow black line .
--> Move on map to reach specfic point using bluetooth .
--> Move and avoid obtacles .

Used (our own drivers)
MCAL LAYER    : DIO , Timers , UART and Interrupts 
HAL LAYER     : UltraSonic , Servo motor , IR sensors , Bluetooth , Dc motors .
Service LAYER : STD_TYPES , BIT_MATHS
